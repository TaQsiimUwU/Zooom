##**Game description:**  
Genre: 3D Third-Person Speed-running Game.

Core Objective: The Player must navigate a series of handcrafted 3D levels from a designated starting point to the goal marker/end point in the shortest time possible. The game challenges the player’s mastery of movement mechanics and level knowledge. 

Inspiration: Fluid movement and level design of Haste: Broken Worlds, Pseudoregalia, and the Time Attack nature of Neon White.

**Proposed Features & Mechanics:**

* **3D World:**  
  * **Description:** Environment composed of handcrafted, geometrically abstract levels to facilitate precise platforming challenges.  
      
  * **Geometric Objects:**  Levels will utilize a mix of primitive shapes for platforms, walls and (possibly) slopes to build and maintain momentum through different movement techniques as well as different assets for (possible) collectibles

* **Camera System:**  
  * A dynamic Third-Person Camera focusing on the character’s movement and providing a sense of speed.

* **User Interaction:**  
  * **Keyboard Movement:** WASD for simple player movements (Forward, Backward, Strafing).  
      
  * **Aerial Movement:** Dedicated controls for jumping and other movement techniques unlocked through gameplay and triggered by user input/proximity to certain obstacles and hazards.  
      
  * **Mouse Look:**  Controlling the camera’s view direction.

* **Animation:**  
  * **Player Character Movement/Animation:** Running/jumping/movement technique animations for the character model.

  * **Moving Obstacles:** Platforms or hazards moving along a predetermined path.

* **Mechanics:**  
  * **Objective:** Move from point A (start point) to point B (End point/Goal) in each level as fast as possible while minimizing damage taken from obstacles/hazards.  
      
  * **Core Gameplay Loop:** Navigation through the environment using a fluid, physics based movement system. A player’s time will be tracked and displayed to encourage speedrunning and replaying levels.

**Used Technologies:**

* **Primary Engine:** Unity  
* **Programming Language:** C\#  
* **Asset Creation:** Blender
